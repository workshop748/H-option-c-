# Ascyn-File Seaarcher malware( for educational purposes)
I am currently enrolled through my colleges Honnors program. I had the option to do a thing called an h-option. Through this, I was able to create a very basic malware that would get all the local users on a machine. Once it got all the users, It would began to search through each directory using a breath first search algorithm to find new files and new directories. If it found a directory, It would then search that till it reached the end. After this search was completed. it would take the jagged list, and call encryptedFileA to encode the file.
